# TestsAgent reference

How the `tests` agent is found, what a call takes and answers, what it writes and edits, how the tests are made, and
how to test it. What it is for is in the [README](../README.md).

## How an app finds it

TestsAgent is a `GraniteAgentPackage`, and it carries a record in its binary:

```swift
@used @section("__DATA_CONST,__granite")
let testsRecord: GraniteRoster.Record = { GraniteRoster.record(TestsAgent.self) }
```

In [Craft](https://github.com/riteshpakala/Craft), install it from the Agent Store or with
`craft agents add https://github.com/rao-craft/TestsAgent.git`, then say `$tests` in a request:

```
$tests prove the recipe app works: its services' work on mock responses, its pages, and each tab at launch
```

The model writes the call (often `{}`); the call shows on Craft's agent map as `tests-1`, and the turn builds and runs
the tests it wrote.

## What a call takes and answers

| Field | | |
|---|---|---|
| `services` | optional | the services whose work is tested, `Recipes` or `RecipesService`; every service with work when left out, none for `[]` |
| `pages` | optional | the pages drawn and driven, `RecipeList`; every page when left out, none for `[]` |
| `ui` | optional | whether to write a UI launch test per destination; true when left out |
| `scenarios` | optional | `normal`, `empty`, `failing`, `slow`: what the mock backend answers in the service tests; all four when left out |
| `rounds` | optional | how many answers the host's model may give for what one page action leaves; 3 when left out |
| `directory` | the host's | the folder the host works in; a host fills it and does not show it to a model, and a call whose JSON leaves it out works in the folder the host offers (`AgentHost.directory`) |

The answer is a `TestsResult`: every file written or edited (`path`, `paths`, absolute), the services, pages and
destinations tested, how many tests, and a sentence for anything left out and why. Calls run one at a time (`lanes`
1): a call edits files other calls share (the app's `App`, its centers, its schemes).

## What it writes

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `Tests/Support/TestRoot.swift` | a `@MainActor` root holding a relay to every service; `boot(_:)` waits until no work is in flight, points every client the services send through at the scenario's mock, waits for persisted stores to load, and clears each service; `answer(_:)` switches the backend mid-test; `settle()`, `quiet()`, `until(_:)` |
| `Tests/Support/ServicesOnMocks.swift` | the one `@Suite(.serialized)` parent every suite nests in (relays are process singletons, and separate suites run side by side) |
| `Tests/Support/<Client>Server.swift` | when `mocks` has written no `.mock()`: an `HTTPTransport` that answers every endpoint from the package's preview values, three pages of two items each with ids of their own and then empty pages, a 500 when failing, late when slow, and keeps every request |
| `Tests/<Service>Tests.swift` | for each piece of work: the field it fills (a second page replaces the first), the next page added, nothing added past the last page, `lastError` set on a failing backend and cleared by a try again with the field kept, `loading` marked while in flight; a request reached the backend; what the Ops do with any other kind the work sets |
| `Tests/<Page>PageTests.swift` | the page drawn with `ImageRenderer` in light and dark, loaded, empty and failing; each `+Actions` function run as a tap runs it (an item from the loaded list, the page refreshed first when it needs something to act on), with the state it leaves |
| `UITests/<App>DestinationTests.swift` | one launch a destination with `-mock YES -destination <case>`, asserting its page's title comes on screen |
| `Shared/Utility/RunMode.swift` | how a launch runs: for a person, on mocks, or hosting the unit tests |

And a few edits, each made once: the app's `WindowGroup` shows its root page only when the app is not hosting its unit
tests (otherwise the pages load through the live client and race the tests on the same services); each persisted
service's store key gains `RunMode.storeSuffix` (`.tests`, or `.mock` on a mock launch), so a test never reads or
writes what a person saved; the iOS scheme runs the UI tests (the macOS scheme keeps them skipped: they need an
interactive session there); a test file that names a package's types without importing the package gets the import.

## How the tests are made

| Step | What |
|---|---|
| Read | the project (by `plutil`): the app's module, its test folders, its schemes; each service's state, store key, writer kinds, ticketed entries, work reducers (what each awaits, writes and marks in flight) and Ops; each client package `network` wrote (endpoints, answers, paging, previews, a `mocks` `.mock()`); each page's relays, inputs, title and actions; the destinations |
| Seams | where a work's call to an endpoint gets its client (`RecipeClient.current`, `Backend.recipes`, `AppRoot.shared.client`), read back to its declaration; a test assigns it. A work that sends through something a test cannot assign, or reaches the network itself, is left out with a note saying what would open it |
| Derive | arguments (page 1, then page 2; a sample of each type; an item the page lists), and every expectation that can be read off the code: the work's write, its loading key, the Ops' assignments for the kinds it sets, a page action's service calls, `set` calls and helpers that forward to `set` |
| Ask | only what a page action leaves when its code does not say (`layout.show(detail: pick.map { … } ?? "")`): the host's model answers at most three Swift boolean expressions over `root.<service>.state` and the action's arguments; each is checked against the services' real fields, parsed with `swiftc -parse`, and asked again with what was wrong; one that never comes right is left out with a note |
| Check | every file staged, parsed with `swiftc -parse`, then moved into the project together; a file at a path it writes that it did not write is refused, never overwritten |

Run them as Craft's checks do: `xcodebuild -scheme <App>-macOS -destination platform=macOS test`, and on the
simulator `xcodebuild -scheme <App>-iOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<iPhone>' test` (the same tests, and
the UI launch tests).

## Testing

```
swift test                                        # the record, the schema, the reading, the tests written, the edits, the model's asks
TESTS_BUILD=1 swift test --filter TestsBuildTests # an app made through the installed runners, its tests run on the Mac and the
                                                  # simulator, and a broken reducer caught (gated, minutes)
```
